# Promo message:

Ruby has been accepted as a project for Google Summer of Code 2018! We're looking for mentors for students who want to work on Ruby open source projects this summer. If you are interested in mentoring a student this summer, please let me know!

For more information about what it's like to be a mentor, Google has written a mentor guide: https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/.

We would also love contributions to the project ideas list, if you have any open source ideas that are one-student-summer sized: https://github.com/rubygsoc/rubygsoc/wiki/Ideas-List.


# Mentor welcome message

Thanks for volunteering. We would love to have your help. :)

There's a short page with a timeline for 2018 here: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline. For mentors, Google has published a manual here: https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/.

I haven't cleaned up previous years yet, but this where we have posted project ideas: https://github.com/rubygsoc/rubygsoc/wiki/Ideas-List. If you have Ruby open source libraries, we'd love to add your ideas for your project to that list! If you have any ideas for projects you’d be interested to mentor on other libraries, let me know and we can work together to get those ideas written up and posted to the ideas list. If there are any ideas already on the list that you’re interested in mentoring or co-mentoring, go ahead and add your name to those projects on the wiki.

Assuming that Ruby is accepted by Google, I will invite you to join the project on summerofcode.withgoogle.com. Do you have a preferred email address/Google account you want to be invited with?

Thanks!
